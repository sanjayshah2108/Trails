# Trails Challenge

Thanks for taking the time to complete our coding challenge. You have ninety minutes to complete the challenge and send it back to al@createwithflow.com.

While completing the challenge keeps this in mind:
* Treat this as a normal task at work. You need use git, comment and test the code as you normally would.
* Please use your best software design practices.
* Complete is better than perfect, try to finish in time.

## Trails

Trails is a simple app that computes projectile motion and displays it on the screen. You get to enter the initial velocity and acceleration and then the projectile moves according to the laws of physics.

## Tasks

The tasks you need to complete:

1. Add another projectile. This new projectile should be drawn with a different colour and have different parameters.
2. Stop the simulation if the two projectiles collide.
3. Draw a trail for each projectile. The trail should remain for the duration of a shot, but should be cleared across shots.
